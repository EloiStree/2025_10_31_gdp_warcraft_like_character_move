> A simple mirror of how a World of Warcraft champion moves, created for an MMO-style coding tournament.

I enjoy learning how to create bots in World of Warcraft purely for fun — from a white-hat perspective, not for profit.

For me, Warcraft is one of the best environments to learn coding.

However, it’s much easier to build a small game in Godot than to manage 4–40 World of Warcraft accounts just to teach programming to students.

This code replicates the behavior of a champion in the game,
except for sky-riding — that part is quite a challenge to reproduce.



I previously tried this in Unity3D:

However, as I’m planning to create a game coding tournament,  
I’m going to focus on having several champions in the scene and less on the camera.
